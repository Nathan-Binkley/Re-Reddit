Hello,

This is a platform manipulation experiment for Reddit. 

There's no Malicious intent here. 

Heck, there's not even bonified code that does anything except upvote/downvote.

The idea is pretty simple:

If someone on Reddit gets 5-10 upvotes and they're early, they set the tone for an ENTIRE THREAD. 
Not only this, but those who read the comments are MORE LIKELY TO BELIEVE WHATEVER IS SAID (within reasonable limits of course).


This works in politics and advertising where someone (or some entity) may want to push a certain narrative.
One user discussed how the `pics` community posted many pictures of Jennifer Aniston, only to see how she had a movie coming out 6 months later.
Numerous other users have described having issues posting politically leaning content on the platform as they tend to get downvoted or removed.

My goal with this project is to manipulate Reddit. But not just manipulate Reddit but also the redditors. 
I plan on making a video to describe what I'm doing and how I did it a bit more in-depth later once the project is more complete.
